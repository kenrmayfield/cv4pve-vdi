## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Service launchers** — connect to VMs via RDP, SSH, PuTTY and any custom tool directly from the Connect button; built-in launchers for mstsc, xFreeRDP, SSH (cmd, PuTTY, GNOME Terminal, xterm, Konsole, macOS Terminal)
- **Per-VM services** — configure one or more services per VM with custom port, credentials and IP; accessible from **Connect → Services...**
- **Service discovery** — auto-detect open ports on a VM and add the matching services in one click
- **Credentials per service** — save username/password per service, or use the Windows Credential Manager on Windows

### Changed
- **Connect button** — SPICE, VNC and all configured services are now grouped in a single dropdown per VM
- **Guest agent badge** — starts gray when first enabled, turns green/red as each VM is checked (no more sudden red flash)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **VNC console** — connect to any running VM or container directly from the app
- **⋮ menu** — new toolbar button with links to documentation, release notes, support, bug report and feature request; Settings and About moved here
- **Update notification** — red badge on the ⋮ button and a menu entry when a new version is available
- **Default view** — choose whether the app starts in Card or List view (Settings → Appearance)
- **Warning banner** — shown when remote-viewer is not configured, with a direct link to open Settings
- **Node, Pool and Tag filters** — each filter section can be shown or hidden independently in Settings; enabling one automatically refreshes the list
- **Reset filters button** — compact × icon inline with the "FILTERS" sidebar header

### Changed
- **Faster refresh** — guest agent status is now cached and re-checked at most every 60 seconds, noticeably faster on large clusters
- **Auto-refresh** — shows a "30s" label when active; replaced internal loop with `DispatcherTimer`, ticks skipped if a refresh is already in progress
- **Settings** — display options arranged in a compact 2-column layout
- **Edit Cluster dialog** — removed Cancel button; close the window to cancel
- **VNC session title** — `.vv` file now includes a `title` field (`node:type/vmid`) visible in the remote-viewer title bar
- **Progress bar** — increased height to 8 px for better visibility
- **Settings Appearance tab** — icon updated to Palette

### Fixed
- SPICE, VNC and RDP buttons were showing as blank boxes in dark theme
- Switching between light and dark theme now correctly updates all colors in the top bar

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-16

We are excited to announce the first public release of **cv4pve-vdi**!

After years of managing Proxmox VE clusters, we wanted a lightweight desktop client that lets you connect to VMs and containers without opening a browser. cv4pve-vdi is exactly that — a fast, cross-platform VDI launcher with SPICE and RDP support and a clean interface that stays out of your way.

Login with your Proxmox VE credentials and manage multiple clusters from a single application.

If you prefer working from the terminal, check out [**cv4pve-pepper**](https://github.com/Corsinvest/cv4pve-pepper) — our companion command-line tool for launching SPICE consoles on Proxmox VE.
